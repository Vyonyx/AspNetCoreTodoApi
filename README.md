# [Asp.NetCore] Todo API

This Web API was an exercise to test my current understanding of C# and dotnet Core (ASP Web API, specifically).

## Learnings

I've noticed that intercepting Http requests is done in a similar pattern when comparing controllers (for Web APIs) and the code behind file for Razor pages.
Automatic model validation is also a nice feature when parsing JSON objects through Http requests. I found out how to use Swagger to test API's near the end, which I found more intuitive than HttpRepl by dotnet. Swagger automatically launches when running dotnet watch run in the terminal (for future reference).
